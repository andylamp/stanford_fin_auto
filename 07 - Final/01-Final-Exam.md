## Deterministic Finite Automata

The questions in this group refer to the following DFA:

![dfa_1][dfa1]

We suggest you first examine the automaton and determine intuitively what 
language it accepts.

### Answer

## Nondeterministic Finite Automata

The questions in this group refer to the following DFA:

![nfa_1][nfa1]

We suggest you first examine the automaton and determine 
intuitively what language it accepts.

## Regular and Context-Free Languages

Classify each of the following languages as either 

 1) regular 
 2) context-free but not regular, or 
 3) not context free 
 
All languages are over the alphabet `{0, 1, 2}`.
