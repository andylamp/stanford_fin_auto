# Week 3, Normal Forms Quiz, Question 2, Stanford Finite Automata.

Let the grammar `G` of `L` be the one below:

`S` -> `AB` | `CD`

`A` -> `BG` | `0`

`B` -> `AD` | `e`

`C` -> `CD` | `1`

`D` -> `BB` | `E`

`E` -> `AF` | `B1`

`F` -> `EG` | `0C`

`G` -> `AG` | `BD`

# Find the nullable symbols

First let's find the symbols that are *immediately* nullable:

 * `B` is nullable (`B` -> `e`)
 
Then using this we can easily see that `D` =>* `e`

 * `D` is nullable (`D` -> `BB` =>* `e`)
 
Now we must find the combination of these that lead to nullable states.

 * `G` is nullable (`G` -> `BD` -> `e`, due to `B`, `D`, already nullable)
 * `A` is nullable (`A` -> `BG`, due to `B`, `G` already nullable)
 
No other symbols can be nullable based on our given grammar `G`, thus the set
of nullable symbols is the following `N` = {`A`, `B`, `D`, `G`}.


# Answers

In my instance I had the following options to select from:

 1. `C` is nullable
 2. `A` is not nullable
 3. `B` is not nullable
 4. `F` is nullable
 
 
From those we had to select the option that was **TRUE**, given the previous statements
we can easily see that the correction is **option 2**: `A` is not nullable.
