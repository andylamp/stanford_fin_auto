# Week 3, Quiz 2, Question 6

Let the grammar `G` of `L` be the one below:

`R` → `ST` | `UV`

`T` → `UV` | `W`

`V` → `XY` | `Z`

`X` → `YZ` | `T`

The above grammar `G`, is one whose variables and terminals are **NOT** named using the usual convention. 
Any of symbols `R` through `Z` could be either a variable or terminal; it is your job to figure out which is 
which, and which could be the start symbol.

# Finding Nemo (or... symbols)

Thing is, there is one big distinction that we can deduce the terminal symbols; a terminal symbol **cannot** be
a generating one; which means that it can only be on the right-side of the productions and never on the left.

From the given rules we can clearly see that `S`, `W`, `Y` and `Z` appear only on the right-side.

Additionally a starting symbol has to be on the left-side and maybe on the right-side depending on the grammar;
we can clearly see that `R`, `T`, `V` and `X` appear on the left-side and `T`, `V` and `X` appear on both sides.
We can deduce with certainty that `R` is a starting symbol.

# Answers

In my instance I had the following options to select from:

 1. `T` must be the start symbol
 2. `X` must be a terminal
 3. `S` must be a terminal
 4. `Z` could be either a variable or a terminal
 

In this question we have to select the option that holds true, which is 
based on the previous statements **option 3**: "`S` must be a terminal".
