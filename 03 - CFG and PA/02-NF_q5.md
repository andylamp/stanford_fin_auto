# Week 3, Normal Forms Quiz, Question 5, Stanford Automata Theory

# Problem definition

Suppose we execute the Chomsky-normal-form conversion algorithm described in the videos. Let `A` → `BC0DE` 
be one of the productions of the given grammar, which has already been freed of `ε`-productions and unit 
productions. 

Suppose that in our construction, we introduce new variable `Xa` to derive a terminal `a`, and when we need 
to split the right side of a production, we use new variables `Y1`, `Y2`,...

# Replacing the production

Now assuming the Chomsky-Normal-Form (CNF) we use the following methodology to break up the relations:

 1. Get rid of useless symbols, ε-productions and unit productions (already done).
 2. Get rid of productions whose bodies are mixes of terminals, or consist of more than one terminal 
 (already done).
 3. Break up production bodies longer than `2`
 
In our case `A` → `BC0DE` is longer than `2`, so we can break it up. Using the defined rules we need to
introduce one variable for the terminal symbol `0`, called `Xa` and has the form `Xa` → `0`; we also need
three additional transitional states that serve the purpose of "chaining everything" together, 
which are the following:

`A` → `BY1`

`Y1` → `CY2`

`Y2` → `XaY3`

`Y3` → `DE`

# Answers

In my instance I had the following options to select from:

 1. `Y2` → `0Y3`
 2. `A` → `Y1B`
 3. `Y3` → `DE`
 4. `Y3` → `Y4D`
 
In this question we have to select the option that is correct based on the mixed body breakup rules, 
which based on the previous statements is **option 3**: "`Y3` → `DE`".
