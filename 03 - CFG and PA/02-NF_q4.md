# Week 3, Quiz 2, Question 4

Let the grammar `G` of `L` be the one below:

`S` → `A` | `B` | `2`

`A` → `C0` | `D`

`B` → `C1` | `E`

`D` → `E0` | `S`

`E` → `D1` | `S`

# Eliminate all unit productions

To do that we first have to create two distinct sets which have the following 
properties:

 1. Set `p1` has all unit productions
 2. Set `p2` has all of productions in our grammar that are **not** unit productions.

Thus, `p1` is comprised out of the following unit productions:

`p1`:

`S` → `A`, `B`, `D`, `E`

`A` → `D`, `S`, `A`, `B`, `E`

`B` → `E`, `S`, `A`, `B`, `D`

`C` → `D`, `S`, `A`, `B`, `D`, `E`

`D` → `S`, `A`, `B`, `D`, `E`

`E` → `S`, `A`, `B`, `D`, `E`

`p2`:

`A` → `C0`

`B` → `C1`

`C` → `3`

`D` → `E0`

`E` → `D1`

`S` → `2`

Now on `p1` we have to remove those rules that exist

Now we have to construct the new rules that follow using `p1` left-side symbols against the 
right-side symbols of `p2` using transitivity.

For `S`: `S` → `C0`, `S` → `C1`, `S` → `E0`, `S` → `D1`

For `A`: `A` → `E0`, `A` → `2`, `A` → `C1`, `A` → `D1`

For `B`: `B` → `D1`, `B` → `2`, `B` → `C0`, `B` → `E0`

For `C`: `C` → `C0`, `C` → `E0`, `C` → `D1`, `C` → `2`, `C` → `C1`

For `D`: `D` → `2`, `D` → `C0`, `D` → `C1`, `D` → `D1` 

For `E`: `E` → `2`, `E` → `C0`, `E` → `C1`, `E` → `E0`

Now the final grammar based on the union of the `p2` and the above is:

`S` → `C0` | `C1` | `E0` | `D1` | `2`

`A` → `C0` | `E0` | `C1` | `D1` | `2`

`B` → `C1` | `D1` | `C0` | `E0` | `2`

`C` → `C0` | `E0` | `D1` | `C1` | `2` | `3`

`D` → `E0` | `C0` | `C1` | `D1` | `2`

`E` → `D1` | `C0` | `C1` | `E0` | `2`

In this answer there are *redundant* symbols, but their elimination was not part of this exercise -- I'll leave it
to you to do it.

# Answer

In my instance I had the following options to select from:

 1. `A` → `D0`
 2. `E` → `3`
 3. `A` → `3`
 4. `B` → `C0`
 

In this question we have to select the option that is part of the new grammar, which is 
based on the previous statements **option 4**: "`B` → `C0`".
