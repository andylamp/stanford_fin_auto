# Week 5, Question 1

Let the Turing Machine (TM), `M` with the following properties:

 * States `p`, `q` with `q` being the start state.
 * Type symbols `0`, `1`, `B`, with `0` and `1` being input symbol while `B` being the blank.
 * Has the following move table:

| State | Tape Symbol | Move |
|-------|-------|-------|
|  `q`  |   `0`   | `(q, 0, R)` |
|  `q`  |   `1`   | `(p, 0, R)` |
|  `q`  |   `B`   | `(q, B, R)` |
|  `p`  |   `0`   | `(q, 0, L)` |
|  `p`  |   `1`   | none (halt) |
|  `p`  |   `B`   | `(q, 0, L)` |

In this question we have to simulate using `M` the input string `w` = `1010110` and identify the correct ID 
(instantaneous description) of `M` from the provided options.

# Expanding of `w`

 1. `q1010110`, found `1` on tape thus `q` → `(p, 0, R)`
 2. `0p010110`, found `0` on tape thus `p` → `(q, 0, L)`
 3. `q0010110`, found `0` on tape thus `q` → `(q, 0, R)`
 4. `0q010110`, found `0` on tape thus `q` → `(q, 0, R)`
 5. `00q10110`, found `1` on tape thus `q` → `(p, 0, R)`
 6. `000p0110`, found `0` on tape thus `p` → `(q, 0, L)`
 7. `00q00110`, found `0` on tape thus `q` → `(q, 0, R)`
 8. `000q0110`, found `0` on tape thus `q` → `(q, 0, R)`
 9. `0000q110`, found `1` on tape thus `q` → `(p, 0, R)`
 10. `00000p10`, found `1` on tape while on state `p` thus we *halt*.

# Answer

In my instance I had the following options:

 1. `10q10110`
 2. `0000000qB`
 3. `0000q110`
 4. `00000000qB`
 
Based on the outline we gave above for the transitions, we can clearly see that the correct answer is 
**option 3**: `0000q110`.
