# Week 5, Quiz 2, Question 2

Which of the following problems about a Turing Machine `M` does Rice's Theorem imply is undecidable?

# Answer

In my instance I had the following options:

 1. Is there some input that causes `M` to halt after no more than 500 moves?
 2. Is the language of `M` empty?
 3. Is the language of `M` a set of strings?
 4. Is the language of `M` recursively enumerable?
 
This was explained in the lectures, the correct answer is **option 2**: Is the language of `M` empty? A little more
explanation would be that the only non-trivial properties that are described in the given options are 2, 4. We know
that all the languages that are accepted in the Universal Turing Machine are recursively enumerate. Additionally, it
is proved in the slides that the 2 is an undecidable problem which you can find [here][1] (slide 19/60).
