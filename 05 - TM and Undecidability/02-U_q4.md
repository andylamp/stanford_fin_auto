# Week 5, Quiz 2, Question 4

We wish to perform the reduction of acceptance by a Turing machine to MPCP, as described in the class videos. 
We assume the TM `M` never moves left from its initial position and never writes a blank. We know the following:

 1. The start state of `M` is `q`.
 2. `r` is the accepting state of `M`.
 3. The tape symbols of `M` are `0`, `1`, and `B` (blank).
 4. One of the moves of `M` is `Î´(q,0)` = `(p,1,L)`.

Which of the following is **DEFINITELY NOT** one of the pairs in the MPCP instance that we construct for the 
TM `M` and the input `001`?


# Answer

In my instance I had the following options:

 1. (`0r`, `r`)
 2. (`r1`, `q`)
 3. (`0q1`, `q`)
 4. (`0q0`, `p01`)
 
 
The correct answer is **option 3**: (`0q1`, `q`), this is because based on the construction rules outlines in the
lectures this is an *invalid* one as *only* the accepting state can "consume" adjacent tape symbols.
