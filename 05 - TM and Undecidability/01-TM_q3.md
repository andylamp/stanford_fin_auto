# Week 5, Quiz 1, Question 3

Let's assume a Turing machine `M` with start state `q0` and accepting state `qf` has the following 
transition function table:

|  `δ(q, a)`  |       `0`     |        `1`      |       `B`      |
|:-----------:|:-------------:|:---------------:|:--------------:|
|   `q_0`     | `(q_0, 1, R)` |  `(q_1, 1, R)`  | `(q_f, B, R)`  |
|   `q_1`     | `(q_2, 0, L)` |  `(q_2, 1, L)`  | `(q_2, B, L)`  |
|   `q_2`     |       -       |  `(q_0, 0, R)`  |        -       |
|   `q_f`     |       -       |         -       |        -       |


In this question we have to deduce what `M` does on any input of `0`'s and `1`'s. 

*Hint*: consider what happens when `M` is started in state `q0` at the *left* end of a sequence of any number 
of `0`'s (including zero of them) and a `1`. 

Demonstrate your understanding by identifying the *true* transition of `M` from the list below.

# Examining `M`

Now if we look at the function transition table of `M`, we might be able to spot that what basically `M` does, is to
flip `0`'s and `1`'s in the string and *finishes* padding a `B` to the string. An example of that would be the 
following: `0110` |-* `1001B`, let's show how this happens.

 1. `[q0]0110`, found `0` on tape thus `q0` → `(q0, 1, R)`
 2. `1[q0]110`, found `1` on tape thus `q0` → `(q1, 1, R)`
 3. `11[q1]10`, found `1` on tape thus `q1` → `(q2, 1, L)`
 4. `1[q2]110`, found `1` on tape thus `q2` → `(q0, 0, R)`
 5. `10[q0]10`, found `1` on tape thus `q0` → `(q1, 1, R)`
 6. `101[q1]0`, found `0` on tape thus `q1` → `(q2, 0, L)`
 7. `10[q2]10`, found `1` on tape thus `q2` → `(q0, 0, R)`
 8. `100[q0]0`, found `0` on tape thus `q0` → `(q0, 1, R)`
 9. `1001[q0]`, found `B` on tape thus `q0` → `(qf, B, R)`
 10. `1001B[qf]`, `M` halts

# Answer

In my instance I had the following answers:

 1. `[q0]0011` |-* `1100[qf]`
 2. `[q0]1100` |-* `0011B[qf]`
 3. `[q0]1010` |-* `1001B[qf]`
 4. `[q0]1010` |-* `1101B[qf]`
 
Based on the above steps we can clearly see that the correct answer to this question is 
**option 2**: `[q0]1100` |-* `0011B[qf]`
