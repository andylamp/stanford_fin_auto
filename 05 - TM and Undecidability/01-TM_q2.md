# Week 5, Question 2

Let the Turing Machine (TM), `M` with the following properties:

 * States `p`, `q` with `q` being the start state.
 * Type symbols `0`, `1`, `B`, with `0` and `1` being input symbol while `B` being the blank.
 * Has the following move table:

| State | Tape Symbol | Move |
|-------|-------|-------|
|  `q`  |   `0`   | `(q, 0, R)` |
|  `q`  |   `1`   | `(p, 0, R)` |
|  `q`  |   `B`   | `(q, B, R)` |
|  `p`  |   `0`   | `(q, 0, L)` |
|  `p`  |   `1`   | none (halt) |
|  `p`  |   `B`   | `(q, 0, L)` |

In this question we have to find the property of the strings `w` that are accepted by the previously defined 
Turing Machine (TM) `M`.

Based on the findings of [Question 1][1], we can clearly see that the property that makes `M` halt is the input string
`w` to have *two* or more consecutive `1`'s.

# Answer

In my instance I had the following options:

 1. `001010`
 2. `00001`
 3. `010110`
 4. `0101`
 
Based on what we said before the correct answer is **option 3**: `010110`, as it is the only one that has *two* or 
more consecutive `1`'s.
