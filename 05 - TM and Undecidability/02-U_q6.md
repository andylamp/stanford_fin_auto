# Week 5, Quiz 2, Question 6

In this question, `L1`, `L2`, `L3`, `L4` refer to languages and `M`, `M1`, `M2` refer to Turing machines. Now Let

 * `L1` = {`(M1,M2)` | `L(M1)` is a subset of `L(M2)`},
 * `L2` = {`M` | There exists an input on which TM `M` halts *within* 100 steps},
 * `L3` = {`M` | There exists an input `w` of size *less* than 100, such that `M` accepts `w`},
 * `L4` = {`M` | `L(M)` contains *at least* 2 strings}.

Decide whether each of `L1`, `L2`, `L3` and `L4` are recursive, RE or neither. Then identify the *true* 
statement below.


# Answer

In my instance I had the following options:

 1. The intersection of `L2` and `L3` is not recursively enumerable.
 2. `L4` is recursive.
 3. The complement of `L2` is not recursively enumerable.
 4. The complement of `L4` is not recursive.
 
The correct answer to this one is **option 4**: The complement of `L4` is not recursive. That's because `L4` is
*not* a recursive language and since the complement is a *closed* operation it follows that the complement of
`L4` is not a recursive language as well.
