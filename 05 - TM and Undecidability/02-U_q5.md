# Week 5, Quiz 2, Question 5

Let's suppose a problem `P1` reduces to a problem `P2`. Which of the following statements can we conclude to be 
**TRUE** based on the above?

# Answer

In my instance I had the following options:

 1. If `P1` is decidable, then it must be that `P2` is undecidable.
 2. If `P1` is RE, then it must be that `P2` is RE.
 3. If `P1` is decidable, then it must be that `P2` is decidable.
 4. If `P1` is non-RE, then it must be that `P2` is non-RE.
 
The correct answer to this question is **option 4**: If `P1` is non-RE, then it must be that `P2` is non-RE.
