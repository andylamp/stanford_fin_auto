# Week 5, Quiz 2, Question 3

Here is an instance of the Modified Post's Correspondence Problem:

|       | List A | List B |
|:-----:|:------:|:------:|
|   1   |   01   |   010  |
|   2   |   11   |   110  |
|   3   |    0   |   01   |

If we apply the reduction of MPCP to PCP described in the class videos, which of the following 
would be a pair in the resulting PCP instance.

# Converting from MPCP to PCP

Following the direction given in the lecture we have to do the following things

 * Recreate the pairs of the original MPCP but on the first element we add `*` after each element while on the second
 element we prepend `*` before each element.
  * We have to add an *ender* state, `($, *$)`
  * Finally we have to add the *first* pair again but with the first element prepended with `*` while the other 
  elements being construct as previously said.
  
The full conversion follows...

|       |      MPCP     |         PCP         | 
|:-----:|:-------------:|:-------------------:|
|   1   | (`01`, `010`) | (`0*1*`, `*0*1*0`)  |
|   2   | (`11`, `110`) | (`1*1*`, `*1*1*0`)  |
|   3   |  (`0`, `01`)  |   (`0*`, `*0*1`)    |
|   4   |       -       |     (`$`, `*$`)     |
|   5   |       -       | (`*0*1*`, `*0*1*0`) |

Of note are rows 4, 5 as they are the ender and the special version of first pair respectively.

# Answer

In my instance I had the following options:

 1. (`1*1`, `*1*1*0`)
 2. (`*$`, `$`)
 3. (`*0*1*`, `*0*1*0`)
 4. (`*1*1*`, `*1*1*0`)
 
Based on the above we can clearly see that the correct answer is **option 3**: (`*0*1*`, `*0*1*0`) which incidentally
has the same value as our special first pair version.
