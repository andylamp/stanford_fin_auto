# Stanford dbclass solutions


In this repository I've compiled my solutions for the exercises and quizzes that I did
during my completion of the Automata Theory class offered [here][1] (for free!) by 
[Prof. Jeff Ullman][2].

In each of the section there are `markdown` (`.md`) files which have both solutions and
any accompanied code. Some questions, and exercises have some  personal notes that I've 
found interesting or useful. As always, take everything with a *grain of salt*.

# Important notes

I sincerely urge you to try and do these exercises yourself in order to get the most 
out of it... and... please... *avoid copy-pasta*. It decreases the value of the course 
for *you* and for others.
